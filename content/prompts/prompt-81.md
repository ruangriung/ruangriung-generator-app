Hyper-realistic photo.
Use reference photo A for the first man → styled as “Om Jin Djarum 76”: wearing a traditional Javanese golden beskap with red sleeves decorated with golden batik accents, paired with a brown batik jarik cloth to the ankles, and a dark batik blangkon on his head. He is in a dynamic pose, leaning slightly forward with one arm extended, as if offering something magical to the second man. His expression looks charismatic yet comedic, with a confident smile.
Use reference photo B for the second man → wearing a modern casual outfit (simple T-shirt and jeans), standing slightly back, reacting with astonishment and curiosity toward the offering.
In front of them is a surreal absurd magic lamp (for example: an old rusty paint can or a broken toaster) glowing brightly. From it rises thick white smoke mixed with colorful sparkles, swirling dramatically around the first man’s outstretched hand.
Background setting: a cozy traditional living room with wooden furniture and soft lighting, or a bustling marketplace with colorful stalls and crowds blurred in the background.
Cinematic atmosphere with a warm golden spotlight enhancing the scene, ultra-detailed fabrics, realistic lighting, magical yet comedic ambience.
