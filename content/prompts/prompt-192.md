a surreal psychedelic humanoid face covered in complex fractal patterns and glowing neon ornaments — symmetrical tribal and cyber-organic motifs carved into metallic skin, illuminated with radiant rainbow colors (green, gold, blue, purple, orange) — one half of the face shadowed by an ornate vertical staff inscribed with alien symbols and embossed patterns — the other half bathed in vibrant psychedelic light — background filled with swirling sacred geometry, fractal filigree, and glowing mandalas — hyper-detailed, ultra realistic texture, 8K high resolution, cinematic lighting, vivid contrast, intricate embossing, mystical aura, Alex Grey inspired visionary art style.
