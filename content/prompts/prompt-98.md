Chaotic psychedelic throne room rendered in a surreal, maximalist style. Glowing fractal patterns cover every wall, floor, and archway while swirling neon chaos floods the space with vibrant psychedelic colors. A massive throne carved from bones and crystal shards rises at the center, framed by an ominous red full moon shining through shattered stained-glass windows. Perched upon the throne, a terrifying wolf faces forward with blazing red eyes, massive fangs dripping fresh blood, and a menacing snarl frozen mid-growl, its matted fur splattered with crimson.

Skeletal vines and cracked skull tendrils coil around the throne and across the floor, merging with spectral wolves that howl in the haze. Chaotic runes and prismatic energy ribbons spiral through the air, conjuring an atmosphere of dark mysticism and overwhelming nightmare beauty. Cinematic, ultra-detailed lighting, terrifying yet mesmerizing.
