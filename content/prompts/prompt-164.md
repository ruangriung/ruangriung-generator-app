Hyper-detailed, hyper-ultra-real montage: a feral voodoo shaman — a fiercely beautiful, primal woman — rendered in an enigmatic 3D engine, alive with otherworldly luminescence. Droste recursion unfurls while liquefy distortion folds into a recursive slice FX and a Fibonacci-sequence kaleidoscope, spiraling inward to impossible infinities; reality seems to drip like molten wax. Her skin is a living map of electric, psychedelic Voronoi tattoos — neon circuitry and phosphorescent veins — with skull face paint framing a mouth of razor fangs as she howls in ritual trance, voice visible as vapor and light. Long white hair braided with feathers, bone talismans and ritual cords, tattooed hands clutching a mystical glass crystal — a luminous prism globe that contains a running tribal horse, animated like a trapped living spirit. Adorned with weathered skull rings, battered leather ornaments and glossy, metallic dark talismans, she stands at the center of multi-exposed, escalated geometry: impossible walls and stairs that bleed water and clouds, extruded shapes and magic FX cascading and folding around her like tectonic fabric. Dramatic, high-contrast cinematic lighting carves her face and the glowing crystal in razor detail — rim light, volumetric fog, and deep shadow — set against a cracked magma backdrop where ancient tribal aesthetic collides with cyber-shamanic ritual style. Photomanipulation intensity meets surreal 3D rendering: glossy wet skin pores and granular textures, metallic patina, cinematic shallow depth of field, haunting color palette of obsidian black, molten amber, acid magenta and neon cyan, cinematic 50mm clarity, ultra-high resolution — a fantastical horror-realism portrait that feels both sacred and absurdly surreal.
