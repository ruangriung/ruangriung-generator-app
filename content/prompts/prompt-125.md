dark surreal art fused with powerful art nouveau poster composition, single elegant feminine figure dancing on the ground, body slightly arched in a graceful ritual pose, feet firmly planted, arms raised, crimson red tattered dress exploding upward into a massive spiral above her, fabric flowing and curling like sacred fire, long silver hair lifted and swirling with the motion, large ornate circular art nouveau halo framing her head, intricate golden floral frames and curling vines surrounding the composition symmetrically, floor cracked with glowing light beneath her, background of desolate gothic arches and misty ruins inspired by Zdzis≈Çaw Beksi≈Ñski, warm sepia and beige tones like aged poster, glowing golden highlights on ornaments and dress edges, cinematic chiaroscuro lighting, painterly texture, elegant yet unsettling, 8k, masterpiece.
