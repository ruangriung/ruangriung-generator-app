A surreal, ultra-detailed composition of a human face built from interlocking puzzle pieces, each fragment revealing hyperrealistic architecture, ancient temples, gothic cathedrals, towers, domes, and cosmic landscapes. The face emerges from a dreamlike collage of buildings, skies, and planets, with vivid, glowing eyes—one golden and one azure—reflecting galaxies and burning suns.

Every puzzle piece uncovers micro-worlds: miniature cities, crumbling ruins, mythic monuments, and cosmic vistas that blend seamlessly into the contours of the human features. Surround the visage with surreal cosmic elements—floating structures, orbiting moons, warped geometry—and amplify the entire scene with 30% more complexity, surrealism, and psychedelia: fractal architecture, twisting organic structures, impossible Escher-like stairways, morphing stone-and-flesh textures, ghostly faces emerging from walls, and shifting luminescent lights.

Introduce a macabre tone with faint skeletal outlines beneath the puzzle layers, red mist seeping through the cracks, decayed ornaments, gothic shadows, and mysterious symbols glowing faintly across the surface. Render the masterpiece in hyperdetailed, high-resolution 8K quality—ultra complex, maximalist, dark surrealist.
