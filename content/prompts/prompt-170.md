A hyper-detailed surreal artwork of a female samurai warrior styled as the Queen of Hearts playing card, radiating elegance, strength, and divine beauty. She wears ornate red-gold armor with layered fabric patterns, flowing silk ribbons, and delicate engravings that mix femininity with warrior power. Her long black hair flows dramatically, adorned with a golden crown-like headpiece shaped like heart motifs.
She holds a katana with heart-shaped guard, glowing softly, surrounded by floating playing cards (hearts and queens) swirling around her as if alive. Her expression is both calm and commanding, embodying the spirit of loyalty and love turned into strength.
The background forms a crimson-to-pink circular gradient resembling a rising sun, symbolizing passion and power. The “Q♥” symbol appears on both upper and lower corners, completing the playing card aesthetic.
The overall art style is 3D layered paper sculpture or relief art, ultra-realistic and painterly, with cinematic shadows, glowing highlights, and intense textures.
