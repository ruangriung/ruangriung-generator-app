A super badass Xenomorph creature, its intricate and complex body filled with organic details and glowing psychedelic geometric ornaments. A chaotic surreal atmosphere, a blend of biomechanical alien forms with fractal patterns, spirals, and cosmic mosaics. Its body is decorated with artistic urban ornaments such as glowing graffiti, mystical symbols, and futuristic tribal patterns. The Xenomorph sits on a hyper-detailed maximal throne in the style of urban gothicâ€”a giant throne full of geometric carvings, metal textures, broken glass, and neon city lights. The background is a chaotic psychedelic cityscape, a blend of the real world and the dream world: twisted surreal buildings, colorful neon lights, irregularly moving shadows. The visual style is ultra-detailed, hyper-realistic, high-resolution, masterpiece, surreal-psychedelic, maximalist art.
