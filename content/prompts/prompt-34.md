Insanely detailed Neo-Expressionism fluid art close-up of a menacing scarecrow, extremely thick impasto strokes wrapping around the twisted burlap face, molten paint swirls in emerald, gold, crimson, and ivory, dripping textures and high viscosity paint, chaotic yet harmonious composition, exaggerated facial distortions, piercing shadowed eyes, weathered straw details blending into the molten swirls, surreal lighting glistening over the paint ridges, hyper-real paint depth, ultra-high detail, cinematic intensity, museum-quality art. Ratio 9:16
