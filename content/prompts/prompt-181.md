A divine Fire Goddess whose skin glows with molten ember veins, her gown of living flame fractals fused to her body, flowing like liquid fire that spirals and curls in rolling fractal waves around her form. Her blazing hair twists upward in fiery fractal coils, glowing gold-crimson like solar storms. She reaches out, fingertip of fire almost touching the Ice Godâ€™s fingertip, his form carved from crystalline frost wrapped in rolling ice fractal spirals radiating icy mist. At their contact, fire and ice fractals entwine in swirling, coiling bursts, releasing glowing steam, frozen crystal dust, ember sparks, and spiraling energy rings. Behind them, a split world of volcanic glow and glacial storm, ultra-detailed, cinematic, divine aura in 8K.
