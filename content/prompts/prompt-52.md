9:16 Minimalist illustration in poster style, clever use of negative space to form hidden visual metaphors. Clean simple lines, overlapping layers of meaning, surprising detail revealed through the empty space. Bold contrasting colors (e.g. blood red, neon yellow, electric blue, deep green, pure black, or stark white) to emphasize emotion and impact. The design should feel thought-provoking, symbolic, and socially critical, like a modern protest poster. Theme: [up to you]. No text.
