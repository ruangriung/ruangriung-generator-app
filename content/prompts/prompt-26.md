A hauntingly beautiful female The Crow, Chinese woman with long flowing raven-black hair, pale ghostly makeup with smeared black eyeliner and lips, surreal and chaotic atmosphere. She wears a tattered dark green cloak merging with swirling neon fractals, glowing crow feathers bursting into psychedelic patterns, her eyes glowing with eerie luminescence. Chaotic surreal background with distorted cityscapes, melting neon signs, fractal crows flying in impossible geometries, dripping paint textures, glitching cosmic light trails. Style: Psychedelic × Chaotic Surrealism × Cinematic painting, highly detailed, dreamlike yet disturbing, bold contrasts, swirling colors, haunting yet mesmerizing aura.
