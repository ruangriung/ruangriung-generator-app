A neo-Baroque work of art with a touch of glitch effect, it depicts a graceful queen against the backdrop of a magnificent Gothic castle. The queen is depicted with a porcelain-pale face contrasting with sparkling blood-red lips, piercing emerald green eyes, and dark brown curls adorned with a large crown adorned with jewels, flowers, and gilded metal ornaments. The crown is richly detailed, featuring rubies, blue sapphires, green emeralds, pink flowers, and intricate mechanical gears.

She wears an extravagant Baroque gown richly embroidered with colorful floral patterns of red, green, blue, gold, and purple, resembling jewels arranged in a circular pattern. The shoulders and sleeves are richly embroidered with textured jewelery, and a large, aristocratic-style white lace collar sits majestically and tightly around her neck.

The backdrop depicts a Gothic castle with pointed black towers in the distance, standing atop a green field with a winding path leading to the castle gate. The sky is turquoise with swirling cloud patterns resembling oil-style brushstrokes.

Adding to the scene, a handsome prince sits quietly on the banks of a small river near the castle, fishing with a classic fishing rod. He is dressed in Baroque aristocratic attire, with a dark blue robe adorned with gold, high leather shoes, and wavy blond hair. This prince creates a contrasting atmosphere: the simplicity of fishing combined with royal grandeur.

The neo-Baroque visuals are combined with glitch effects, making the ornaments of his clothing, crown, and castle details vibrate, breaking into neon pixels of red, cyan, and purple, and then reintegrating. The dominant colors are gold, red, green, sapphire blue, purple, and pearl white, with splashes of neon glitch.
