a funny traditional Indonesian puppet with a bright red smiling face, big round yellow eyes full of mischief, thick black mustache and tiny goatee, wide pink lips showing a single white tooth, playful expression as if about to tell a joke, wearing a cute black headcloth with a little white flower on top, dressed in traditional black outfit with a cheerful blue plaid scarf over the shoulder, holding a tiny orange puppet friend, set against a simple beige wall, cartoonish lighting, colorful and humorous atmosphere, joyful and expressive character design
