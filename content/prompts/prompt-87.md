A man (use reference image) with his head fully passing through the hole of a giant donut, the oversized donut resting around his neck like a collar. The donut is massive, covered with colorful sprinkles, emphasizing a surreal and humorous effect. Captured from a top-down angle, his joyful expression is clearly visible as he eats the donut while it encircles his neck. The background shows a lively Indonesian traditional market or modern supermarket, with stalls, products, and local details adding cultural atmosphere. Highly detailed textures of the donut, toppings, and environment, playful surreal photography style, ratio 9:16
