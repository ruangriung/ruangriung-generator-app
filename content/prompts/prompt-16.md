A realistic photo of a furious Asian woman with glowing red eyes, wearing futuristic robotic armor made of liquid metal and glowing wires. Steam rises from her shoulders as she rides a massive, roaring dragon with iridescent scales that shift between neon greens, electric blues, and hot pinks. The dragon’s eyes burn with intense, glowing neon yellow. The woman grips a giant warhammer made of crystal shards, dragon bone, and pulsing energy, with electric blue and bright violet lightning crackling from it. The sky is shattered into jagged glass shards, each piece glowing with blinding neon colors—bright electric pinks, acidic yellows, neon greens, and fiery reds—reflecting and distorting the chaotic world below. Complex, jagged geometric shapes like floating hexagons, fractals, and sharp, angular pyramids twist and pulse with radiant neon hues. The ground is cracked with fractured glass and shards of mirror reflecting the neon chaos. Long, neon-colored vines in bright hues of pink, orange, and violet snake through the air, wrapping around floating ruins and upside-down mountains. Rivers of glowing neon liquid light flow upward in electric purples, radiant oranges, and neon blues. Mechanical birds, origami dragons, and other surreal creatures soar through the scene, glowing with aggressive neon pinks, greens, and yellows. The entire environment is awash in an overwhelming storm of neon colors—vibrant, intense, and jarring, as if reality itself is being torn apart by the overwhelming energy of light and color.9:16 ratio
