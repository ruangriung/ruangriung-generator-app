A surrealist portrait of an Asian gothic woman blends the biomechanical surrealism of H.R. Giger with the elegance of Gustav Klimt's golden ornamentation.
The body and its surroundings merge into a biomechanical cathedral of organic tubes, skeletal structures, and alien-like forms, fused with luminous golden patterns, swirling ornaments, and intricate mosaics.
Golden fractal spirals overlay the metallic biomechanical textures, creating a divine yet eerie atmosphere.
Highly detailed 8K resolution, cinematic lighting, surreal gothic elegance combined with decorative Art Nouveau, intricate patterns shimmering like gold leaf, and biomechanical alien structures emerging from the shadows.
The atmosphere is dark, mysterious, yet divine, with a balance of horror and beauty.
