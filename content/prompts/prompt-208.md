A towering gothic figure with cascading dreadlocks streaked in vivid purple, green, yellow, and red, baring a thousand serrated teeth, obsidian irises blazing while a long tongue unfurls. Jagged, spiked iron ornaments and serrated metal filigree weave through the hair, paired with a dark navy knitted shirt stretched across tattooed arms. The background erupts in distorted psychedelic light, crammed with surrounding skulls and warped film grain texture, while ominous ancient symbols hover in the haze. Infuse the scene with a tattered, antique steampunk mood: the figure grips a violin studded with tiny whirring gears, encircled by tarnished pipes, valves, and mechanical tubing that frame the composition. Emphasize the gritty grunge contrast, cinematic lighting, and a full HD, masterpiece finish.
