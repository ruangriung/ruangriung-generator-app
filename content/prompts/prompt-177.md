  "prompt": "Close-up 1/3 side profile hyper-detailed portrait of Ayu Dian in Dark Esoteric Maximalism style. Her face glows with emerald and gold light, and from her forehead rise two massive horns made of radiant red energy, like sculpted flames of divine power. The horns emit swirling embers and fiery trails that illuminate her silver hair. Her eyes reflect sacred glyphs and fractal sigils of emerald light. Around her, the air distorts with spiritual heat, as glowing runes and esoteric symbols hover in motion. The background fades into shadowy clay reliefs carved with complex esoteric patterns, glowing faintly with inner fire.",
