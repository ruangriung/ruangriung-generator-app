5 different southeast asian figures (male and female), each appearing as if **strongly dissolving**, with their **faces and bodies visibly melting into dense, detailed dust particles** carried by a gentle wind. Ensure realistic anatomy and proportions while blending the dissolving effect naturally, but with high emphasis on the melting faces and particle detail.  

Apply a **split toning / color grading inspired by AADC poster**, using **solid color variants with smooth, attractive gradients**:  
- **Highlights**: rich warm orange tones on skin, hair, and main features.  
- **Shadows**: deep cool blue tones in the background and remaining parts of the figures, creating cinematic depth and contrast.  

Dust particles should be highly visible, with subtle color hints following the split tone (warm for highlights, cool for shadows). Use **soft cinematic lighting**, **gentle contrast**, and **slightly blurred motion in the dust** to convey wind and movement. Emphasize emotional intensity and visual harmony across all 5 figures.
