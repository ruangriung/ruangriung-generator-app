Create a high-quality 9:16 photo-realistic image. Use the uploaded reference photo for the man’s exact face and body pose. He is sitting on the front terrace of a traditional Yogyakarta house with red brick walls and several potted plants, midday lighting. In his hand, he is holding and playing a wayang golek puppet. The puppet must have the exact same face as the man in the reference photo, but carved in detailed wooden texture with puppet-like features. Dress the puppet in modern attire: light blue long-sleeve shirt, brown batik sarung, and black blangkon headwrap. Focus on sharp details of both the man’s real face and the puppet’s wooden carved version, highlighting their identical expressions.
