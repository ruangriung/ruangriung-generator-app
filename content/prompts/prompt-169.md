"A fantasy-themed image showing a gypsi woman, wearing a dark, intricate outfit with a flowing sheer skirt and boots. They are standing on a sandy or dusty ground, which is covered with various digital image frames or screens. In the background, there's a massive, spiraling tunnel or vortex made of countless illuminated digital screens, displaying different images. The overall setting appears to be an open, barren landscape with distant structures, possibly suggesting a desert or futuristic environment. The sky is bright and clear, possibly daytime. The style is digital art with a touch of surrealism and high detail, futuristic, ethereal."
