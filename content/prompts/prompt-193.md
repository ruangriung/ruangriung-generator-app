A chaotic psychedelic surrealism masterpiece of a divine woman’s face dissolving into a storm of liquid light and cosmic chaos. Her skin morphs into living fractals of neon colors — blazing magenta, ultraviolet, cyan, emerald, gold, crimson, and electric orange — swirling like molten dreams. Thousands of tiny glowing beads and fractal spirals dance across her face, melting into iridescent rivers flowing into a kaleidoscopic water surface. Her tear becomes a droplet of rainbow plasma that explodes into waves of light. The background erupts with floating temples, glowing moons, abstract energy lines, and dimensional distortion — bending reality like a dream collapsing into color. The entire scene vibrates with surreal energy, reflections shimmer like oil on water, and the atmosphere feels alive, divine, and unrestrained. Ultra-detailed, 8K, vibrant chaotic composition, infinite color depth, glowing particles, surreal fusion of liquid, geometry, and emotion.
