Chaotic psychedelic surrealism, infinite fractal labyrinth filled with glowing geometric ornaments, kaleidoscopic symmetry bursting in vibrant neon colors, swirling liquid dimensions colliding with crystalline shards, floating skull vines wrapped around cosmic planets, sacred geometry patterns overlapping with shifting mandalas, glitchwave distortions, chaotic dreamscape throne room made of melted clocks, prismatic stained-glass ruins, infinite reflections, surreal hybrid creatures morphing into abstract patterns, everything vibrating in kaleidoscopic chaotic energy, epic and aesthetic, ultra-detailed, maximalist visionary art. Ratio 9:16.
