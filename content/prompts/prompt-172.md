An alternate version of a fantasy-style robot composed entirely of detailed black and white binary code (0s and 1s). The robot has a humanoid structure but appears more futuristic and alien, with angular shapes and glowing lines. Its body is formed from layered, intricate binary code patterns, creating a high-contrast, monochrome visual.

The background features a digital rain of green binary digits falling vertically, inspired by the Matrix, giving a deep cybernetic ambiance. The style is dark, surreal, and complex with enhanced texture and contrast. Vertical aspect ratio for a full-body portrait.
