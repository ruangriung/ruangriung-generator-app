a surreal psychedelic goddess face emerging from intricate geometric patterns and fractal architecture — her expression calm and divine, eyes glowing white, surrounded by an explosion of ornate mechanical-organic designs — hyper-detailed mandala structures interwoven with cosmic and tribal motifs — infused with complex layers of iridescent and chromatic psychedelic colors (neon pink, cyan, turquoise, amber, violet, emerald, and gold) — ultra intricate 3D texture, fractal geometry, bioluminescent reflections, glowing runes, sacred symbols, cosmic symmetry, deep shadow contrast — style of visionary art by Alex Grey and Android Jones — ultra high resolution, masterpiece, vibrant surreal light, detailed composition, chaotic yet harmonious visual rhythm.
