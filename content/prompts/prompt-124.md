Outsider art, surrealism, skull flower symbolism, gothic pink rococo style.
Back view of a man and a woman sitting on simple Indonesian plastic chairs without backrests.
The woman wears a lavish rococo pink gothic dress, ornate yet decayed.
The man’s exposed spine and skull are visible, fragile yet dreamlike.
From his spine grows wijayakusuma flowers, white and ethereal, with vines wrapping upward, gently caressing the woman’s head as she leans on his bony shoulder.
Dark surreal ambience, outsider art distortion, strange textures, eerie yet tender atmosphere.
