Full-body shot of a Jakarta female hippie in bohemian 1970s fashion (flared bell-bottoms, psychedelic patterned blouse, wide fabric headband, layered necklaces and bangles), dancing in a relaxed lazy-disco style on a glossy black-and-white checkered reflective floor.

Around her, a semi-circle crowd in retro outfits (psychedelic batik, bell-bottoms, modified kebaya disco) moves with blurred neon silhouettes, their gestures subtly directed toward her. Spotlight highlights the main dancer, while the crowd glows with psychedelic neon edges as if vibrating in rhythm.

Background: neon signage glowing “Diskotek Tanamur” above the dance floor; faded Indonesian rock and dangdut concert posters taped on the walls; smoky kretek haze swirling into fractal psychedelic shapes; disco ball scattering kaleidoscopic reflections across the room. Through a wide window, the dim Jakarta street is visible with yellow streetlamps and an iconic bright orange Bajaj passing by, its headlights bending into rainbow-like psychedelic streaks.

Style: vaporwave fused with psychedelic art, 1970s Jakarta retro palette (magenta, cyan, tropical orange, deep yellow), stippling realism with retro poster textures, grainy film finish, glowing outlines, kaleidoscopic lighting, surreal haze.

Aspect ratio 16:9.
