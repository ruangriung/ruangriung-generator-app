Chibi punk style digital illustration of a tough guy with neon blue-green hair tied in a high ponytail with a red ribbon, smoking a cigarette, the ends of his hair glowing yellow-green. Serious face, Big red earplugs and many piercings. His body is covered in colorful street art style tattoos, with a large jacket with a large tattoo design on his back. Wearing ripped green cargo pants and covered in graffiti 'RuangRiung', monster faces, and wild symbols. Custom sneakers with colorful writing. Left hand pointing at the camera, right hand holding a glass cup of black coffee. The background is full of red graffiti murals, wild letters, paint splatters, urban street gang feel. Dramatic lighting, very detailed, modern digital illustration style, high saturation, sharp focus.
