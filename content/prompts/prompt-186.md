A surreal street art poster featuring a large colorful umbrella covered with graffiti tags, stickers, and logos, dripping paint in black, red, blue, and orange tones. Underneath the umbrella, bold 3D graffiti text 'RuangRiung' with sharp edges and metallic reflections splashes with dripping paint, blending into an abstract urban background. The umbrella handle is golden, shiny, and chained at the center. The poster includes random graphic logos, labels, and distorted typography arranged around the canvas in a collage layout.

The overall style is modern graffiti art mixed with pop culture poster design, street punk aesthetic, bold outlines, splatter paint effects, grunge textures, typographic chaos, and vibrant ink bleed.

High detail, UHD 8K resolution, full poster composition, center-framed layout, inspired by underground street art and retro comic magazine cover design.
