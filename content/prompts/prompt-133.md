IMAGEN 4

Messy data-moshing with ASCII scattered distortion effect, recursive prism mirror reflections, shiny 3D transparent porcelain texture overlay on the subject. Angry expression, dynamic pose. Manipulated facial cavities enhanced with mechanical gear equipment, combined with rusty metallic machinery details. Neon-lit background with morphing reveals, intricate high-detail rendering, strong brightness and surreal glitch aesthetic.

A gigantic octopus with mechanical structures fused into its body, biomechanical tentacles covered with gears, pistons, and glowing cybernetic implants. The exact face, body shape, and posture from the provided photo reference must be preserved — do not alter facial structure, expression, or proportions.

The scene uses unique, complex, and maximalist chaotic camera angles — tilted perspectives, wide-angle distortions, and recursive reflections that emphasize scale and surreal intensity.
