Liquify effect surreal photo manipulation of a beautiful charming Korean woman, porcelain white ceramic skin, wearing a flowing green and black dress that is melting away, the fabric liquifies into surreal waves and dripping streams, dissolving into a fractal nightmare landscape. The lower part of her dress completely transforms into swirling liquify textures, hollow holes, glowing fractal honey white accents, and abstract honeycomb shapes. In the foreground, a rustic kampung wooden house stands near her, with visible wooden textures in warm earthy brown. A mini waterfall with shimmering blue water flows beside the house into the fractal terrain, crossed by a small wooden bridge. Behind them, towering fractal white honey trees glow eerily, their branches twisting upward. Her glossy red lips and elegant long earrings glisten under dramatic cinematic lighting. Ultra detailed, UHD, surreal fantasy art, full body 9:16 vertical ratio, vibrant surreal colors.
