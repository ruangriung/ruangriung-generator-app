Neon Vortex Tribal Goddess — a hyperdetailed surreal portrait of a divine tribal warrior woman engulfed in a spiraling neon vortex of light and color. Her face is adorned with glowing tribal tattoos and bioluminescent paint in hues of cyan, magenta, gold, and electric violet. A massive headdress of radiant feathers swirls with motion — each feather glowing like plasma, forming a vortex halo around her head. Her eyes shine like twin galaxies, reflecting the colors of the cosmos. The air vibrates with energy: neon dust, holographic sparks, and glowing geometric symbols spin around her. Her expression is fierce and divine, representing ancient power fused with futuristic energy. Hyperrealistic lighting, ultra-detail 8K resolution, cinematic color contrast, glowing ambient reflections, vibrant chaos, dynamic motion, spiritual energy vortex, cosmic tribal surrealism, masterpiece, unreal engine quality, volumetric light rays, psychedelic symmetry, radiant aura.
