**Prompt:**
A vertical cyber-fantasy digital artwork. A powerful female warrior with a calm yet fierce expression stands in the center, fused with two snarling wolf heads on each side of her shoulders. Her body is fully covered in intricate chrome and dark metal biomechanical armor with swirling, baroque-like engravings. Her face is porcelain-white with glowing purple eyes, crowned with an elaborate metallic headdress featuring sharp, spiked, and fractal patterns. Chrome cables and coiled wires wrap around her body like serpents, merging into a throne-like structure in the background. The atmosphere is dark and futuristic, with a dominant color palette of deep purple, black chrome, silver, and electric blue. Everything is glossy, hyper-detailed, and symmetrical. No flowing liquid. Extreme close-up full-body shot in vertical composition. Masterpiece, high contrast, cinematic lighting.
