  "prompt": "Abstract impasto painting on crumpled hard canvas. A feminine figure with Southeast Asian features, oval face, warm brown skin tone with a subtle natural glow, expressive dark eyes, and flowing black hair partially styled back. Makeup is minimal, with balanced tones and no exaggerated blush. She stands upright in a tight, strapless navy dress with metallic button details down the front, the fabric elegantly accentuating her curved silhouette with a fuller upper body form. One arm extends to touch a vertical glass door frame, the other rests naturally at her side. A small shoulder bag hangs at her side, blending into the expressive strokes. Extreme impasto style with thick oil layers applied through coarse bristle brushstrokes. The surface reveals natural crumpled canvas texture with irregular folds, creases, and organic relief patterns breaking through the paint layers, creating a raw tactile rhythm. Background rendered with distorted architectural perspective: doorway, reflective glass, and angled walls dissolving into energetic abstract brushwork. Color palette of deep navy, crimson, burnt sienna, and ivory highlights, with reds reserved for the environment and dress, keeping facial tones natural.",
