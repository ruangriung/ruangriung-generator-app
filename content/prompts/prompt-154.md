**Prompt:**
A surreal horror-inspired artwork of a strong female Greek statue standing tall inside a grand temple. She wears a flowing cloth draped around her lower body, her marble form muscular and elegant. In her hands, she holds a cracked, shiny urn, from which spills an iridescent black liquid resembling a cosmic nebula. The dark, glowing fluid spreads across the temple floor, covering it entirely in a dense pattern of countless staring eyes and cryptic strange symbols. The atmosphere is unsettling yet beautiful, with haunting detail in the liquid patterns. The temple itself is illuminated in cream-white tones, with tall Greek columns and an airy, classical design. The contrast between the pure white marble and the ominous liquid creates a surreal, otherworldly horror aesthetic. The artwork should feel highly detailed, uncanny, and dreamlike.
