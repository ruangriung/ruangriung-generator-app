A high-contrast, modern sports graphic design poster with a 9:16 aspect ratio, featuring Lionel Messi in multiple dynamic action poses. Messi is wearing a Barcelona Champions League kit (e.g., dark blue or black away kit from a specific Champions League season, with relevant sponsor logos visible). The central theme is the UEFA Champions League. The background has a white-to-light-gray grunge texture with a faint, circular text pattern repeating 'LIONEL MESSI'. The prominent UEFA Champions League logo is positioned at the top. Messi should be captured with a professional and energetic feel, showing various action shots like dribbling, celebrating, or shooting. The overall atmosphere should be inspirational and sharp, with a focus on high detail.
