Baroque chiaroscuro oil painting portrait of Ayu Dian reimagined as a nightmarish humanoid apparition. Her pale, decayed skin is rendered with hyper-detailed painterly textures that reveal rotting flesh and mottled bruises beneath the dramatic light. Half of her face has collapsed into an exposed skull crawling with maggots, while the remaining flesh strains around hollow, glowing eyes that burn through the darkness.

Her torso is ripped open, ribs and sinew forming a grotesque secondary visage that snarls from within her chest cavity. Strands of unsettling, long silver hair spill across her shoulders in messy, damp clumps that catch the limited light like tarnished wire. The portrait leans heavily into Rembrandt and Caravaggio-inspired chiaroscuro, pushing the contrast between illuminated horror and engulfing shadow to a museum-grade intensity.

Frame the composition vertically in a 9:16 ratio, with the figure emerging from a museum-like void that fades into deep blackness. Keep the mood cursed, ominous, and reverentialâ€”an unsettling relic hanging in a dark gallery, painted with classical realism and exquisite Baroque detail.

Negative prompt: cartoon, anime, digital fantasy, modern photography, soft light, pastel tones, ue5.
