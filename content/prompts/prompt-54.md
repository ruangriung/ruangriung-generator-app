Grotesque terrifying creature with glowing vibrant eyes emerging from a chaotic collage of torn old newspapers, ripped paper edges floating dramatically in the air. Background layered with overlapping fragments of yellowed newsprint, scratches, and rough textures, giving a surreal cinematic atmosphere. Bat-like tendrils twist around the creature, full moon glowing above with silhouetted howling wolves. Psychedelic surreal lighting with neon hues contrasting the aged newspaper textures, ultra-detailed, high contrast, cinematic horror-psychedelic aesthetic, 8 K resolution
