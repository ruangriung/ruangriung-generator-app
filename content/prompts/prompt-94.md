The image style is set as a cinematic portrait in film-style photography, focusing on human realism and fine detail.
A 25-year-old Asian man with bright light-blue hair, handsome with a strong build, flawless fair skin, and sharp yet smooth facial features.
The highlight is his large charismatic black eyes that radiate strength and calm.

Cosplay detail: Cosplaying Gaara (Naruto) in an iconic, hyper-detailed, and accurate costume that looks lifelike.
On his back is Gaara’s large gourd, rendered with realistic texture.
The background is intensified with a powerful double exposure of Shukaku, blending swirling sand and the beast’s looming form to amplify the magical, dramatic, and epic atmosphere.

Pose and composition: He stands in a side-angle shot, face intensely focused on the viewer, with his right hand pointing directly at the camera in a serious, powerful gesture that radiates dominance, energy, and strength.

Visual style: Bright colors with high saturation deliver a vivid, dramatic, and energetic feel.
Full body shot, dynamic camera angles, and cinematic film techniques amplify the epic and charismatic mood.
Aspect ratio 9:16, ideal for modern full-screen mobile portraits.
