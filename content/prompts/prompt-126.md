Ultra-detailed digital artwork, subject based on reference photo (keep exact face details, do not alter identity). Subject in a dynamic pose, captured in 3D space, interacting with the ornate surroundings. The figure touches, leans on, or emerges from the majestic Nusantara-inspired ornamental structures, as if alive within the intricate world.

Attire is luxurious traditional Javanese clothing — either a beskap or kebaya richly embroidered with layered gold filigree, batik patterns, and ancient motifs. Surrounding ornaments reflect the grandeur of pre-Christian-era Nusantara kingdoms: sacred temple carvings, intricate reliefs, wayang-inspired patterns, glowing mandalas, and mythical guardian figures rendered in gold.

Surreal motifs enhance the scene: floating golden temples bending in impossible angles, giant flowers and mythological beasts woven seamlessly into the sky, luminous rivers flowing upward across the chamber, and vines glowing like constellations. Elements dissolve and reform as if the world itself is alive and breathing, merging fantasy and dreamlike illusions into reality.

If the subject is female → giant vibrant tropical flowers (orange, pink, emerald green) intertwine with her kebaya and hair, some held in hand, others blooming around her in surreal floating motion.
If the subject is male → mythological beasts of Nusantara (such as naga, garuda, or singa barong), golden mandalas, or metallic reliefs respond to him in surreal ways — wrapping around his body like living light, emerging from the walls, or glowing as if alive.

Background expands into a full 3D royal Nusantara chamber, with golden arches, sacred ornaments, and monumental gateways opening into a surreal fantasy cityscape and mountains that ripple and shift like dreams, illuminated like a mythic ancient kingdom. The artwork is maximalist, hyper-detailed, immersive, cinematic lighting, dynamic perspective, 8K resolution, masterpiece.

Negative Prompt:
flat, blurry, distorted face, deformed hands, stiff pose, low resolution, cartoonish, empty space, simple background
