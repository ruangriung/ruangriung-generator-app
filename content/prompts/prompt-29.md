A surreal and dark nightmare-themed image. A large, intricate black rose is in a 9:16 vertical composition. The rose is created using a double exposure technique with a shattered and broken Earth, where the petals and fractured planet are dripping with glowing, molten magma. A chaotic and ruined cityscape is integrated within the center of the rose and across the Earth's surface. Numerous sharp, winding tendrils emerge from the rose's stem and leaves, while intricate, glowing ancient script and symbols surround the flower. The color palette is dominated by dark grays and blacks, contrasted by the bright, fiery orange and red of the magma. The background is a cosmic, dark gray abyss with distant stars.
