A hyper-realistic portrait of a Japanese demon woman (Oni) with white-painted skin covered in red and black ritual patterns, sharp demonic eyes with white sclera and tiny pupils, and a sinister expression full of restrained fury.
Two large crimson horns curve from her skull, while black disheveled hair cascades around her face, adorned with red bead ornaments that catch the moody light.
Her layered kimono displays intricate traditional patterns in red, black, and gold, each thread rendered with fine textile texture and weathered elegance.
Dramatic, cinematic lighting carves out every facial groove and highlights the eerie atmosphere, balancing terror with refined beauty.
Ultra-detailed, 8K resolution, dark fantasy aesthetic, terrifying yet elegant, Japanese folklore Oni style, trending on ArtStation, masterpiece quality.
