Chaotic psychedelic T_Tangka vision exploding with color and texture, centered on a colossal Cyclops deity. The muscular yet skeletal figure glows with one radiant eye that beams cosmic energy across the composition.

Tattered robes of fire and neon smoke twist around exposed ribs and luminescent veins, while fierce guardian spirits circle overhead with blazing halos, warped smiles, and surreal forehead cannons unleashing radiant lances.

Writhing dragons coil through the maelstrom, their iridescent scales shimmering as they breathe psychedelic fire that fuses with ornamental skulls and fractal mandalas. Behind them, a vortex of glitching sacred geometry, rainbow tendrils, neon vines, and pixelated shards erupts outward.

Rendered in an electric palette of acid pinks, molten oranges, glowing cyans, ultraviolet purples, and radiant greens—every surface erupts in hyper-detailed 8K textures that amplify the scene’s divine, monstrous, and transcendent energy.
