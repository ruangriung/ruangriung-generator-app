A stunning neo-tribal fusion artwork featuring Elinia, a chic Chinese girl with blunt bangs and shoulder-length black bob hair, wearing her signature oversized army green T-shirt with the name "Elinia" printed on it, loose dark brown baggy trousers, and chunky beige slip-on shoes. She holds her folded umbrella like a mystical tribal staff, glowing with geometric patterns. Her style fuses futuristic neon tribal tattoos with organic spirals, sacred geometry, and abstract tribal patterns glowing across her outfit and background. The silver chain necklace around her neck reflects neon lights, while her silhouette blends urban streetwear with ancient tribal energy. Background filled with glowing fractal tribal murals, psychedelic neon patterns, and chaotic yet aesthetic fusion of ancient symbols and modern digital art. Cinematic lighting, detailed textures, high-resolution, surreal and bold.
