A surreal ultra-detailed masterpiece of a white woman with porcelain skin and red mystical runes glowing across her face and body, standing in a Hypervoronoi Matrix throne room — a labyrinth of fractal geometry, crystalline algorithmic structures, and recursive spatial distortions. The environment is an impossible architecture of shifting grids, holographic shards, pulsating veins of red and white energy weaving through infinite Voronoi cells.

The throne itself is alive — constructed from interlocking hypercubes, liquid metal geometry, and fractal light veins that ripple like sentient circuits. The woman radiates godlike presence, wearing a ceremonial robe made of morphing Voronoi tessellations and glowing digital silk that bends reality around her.

Behind her, an endless cascading wall of recursive glyphs and data streams falls like a waterfall of code. The air is filled with shimmering particles, floating polyhedral fragments, quantum distortion fields, and light refraction anomalies. Her eyes emit burning red holographic rays, reflecting infinite parallel worlds.

Style: Hypervoronoi, HyperMatrix aesthetic, surreal fractal realism, 8K ultra detail, cinematic lighting, godlike composition, volumetric light rays, refracted reflections, chaotic energy symmetry.

Keywords: hyper detailed maximal, surreal complex geometry, holographic chaos, cyber arcane energy, multidimensional throne, impossible architecture, recursive fractal temple, ultra depth of field, volumetric smoke and energy particles, divine and terrifying aura.
