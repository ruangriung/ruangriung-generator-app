A mysterious woman with a hooded cloak, her face illuminated in deep contemplation, painted in an explosion of psychedelic neon colors. The entire image glows with rainbow fractal patterns, iridescent textures, and liquid-like details, as if her skin and clothing are made of shifting stained glass and cosmic oils. Surreal, vibrant, ultra-detailed, kaleidoscopic energy, glowing outlines, high-contrast lighting, dreamlike atmosphere, visionary art, spiritual and mystical aura.
