Magazine poster design featuring Ekinia Candia, a stylish young woman model. Layout collage style with multiple poses of her. Top pose: confidently standing with one hand on her head, wearing a brown hoodie layered with a light khaki jacket that has subtle embroidery on the sleeves. Middle pose: smiling warmly with loose natural hair, soft lighting highlighting her face. Bottom pose: playful, flashing a peace sign in the same outfit, the slightly oversized jacket delivering casual streetwear vibes.

Background showcases bold urban street-art energy with torn-paper textures, spray-paint graffiti elements in orange and yellow, abstract shapes, and layered typography. Add yellow diagonal tape with bold black text “EKINIA CANDIA” plus Japanese katakana characters running across the layout.

Typography direction: place “EKIN AI STUDIO” vertically on the side. Main headline “EKINIA CANDIA™” appears in a strong urban font with a yellow paint-splash effect. Include a description box containing the short bio text: "Ekinia Candia, dikenal sebagai Ekinia, adalah seorang model dan inspirasi kreatif yang penuh gaya dan inovatif" and the detail "Birth: December 05, 2000".

Overall mood: modern, urban, stylish, playful, and confident poster design.
