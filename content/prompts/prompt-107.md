Epic surreal psychedelic artwork in the style of a Javanese wayang kulit tapestry. At the center, a skeletal dalang wayang sits cross-legged in meditation, wrapped in glowing batik cloth with intricate parang and kawung motifs. His skull face is calm and powerful, with a fiery crown of mystical flames above his head, but without glowing eyes or laser beams. Around him, fierce raksasa wayang guardians stand guard, holding keris and gada, their bodies richly decorated with wayang patterns and ornaments. Two colossal naga Jawa coil symmetrically around the composition, breathing cosmic fire, their scales carved with traditional batik ornament. The entire scene is framed with surreal floral batik patterns, cosmic skulls, and gamelan instruments floating in a psychedelic cosmic background. Hyper-detailed, maximalist, colorful, ornate, cinematic, 8k resolution.
