surreal hyperrealistic depiction of a woman in a jester gown, monochrome pixel-art aesthetic, holding a paintbrush in one hand and a paint palette in the other, painting her own lips; floating pixel blocks in the background, glitch distortions, fragmented playing cards pixelizing and breaking apart, eerie digital atmosphere; pure monochrome tones except for the lips, paint palette, wet paint strokes, and brush tip which are vivid in color; pixelated texture, subtle scanline effect, dreamlike yet unsettling mood
