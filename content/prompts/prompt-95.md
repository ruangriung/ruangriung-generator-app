A female Crow warrior stands inside a Hypervoronoi Matrix fractal dimension filled with infinite glowing geometric cells and shifting impossible structures. Dress her in dark leather mixed with raven feathers, torn fabrics, gothic jewelry, and black war paint, with haunting glowing eyes. Surround her with twisted cracked skull tendrils that coil like living shadows across the architecture in neon pink, acid green, electric blue, and radiant purple. Add floating geometric ornaments, fractal halos, and kaleidoscopic shards that bend reality around her. Emphasize a surreal, ultra-detailed, chaotic-psychedelic atmosphere with hyperrealistic lighting, cinematic drama, and an epic, badass female interpretation of The Crow amid vibrant colors and nightmare-beautiful skull tendrils.
