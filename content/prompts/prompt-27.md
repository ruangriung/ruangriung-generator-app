  "prompt": "In the far lower left corner of the composition, a full anomalous black dog is the primary focus. The dog appears uncanny and surreal, with elongated legs, glowing eyes, and a distorted, unsettling body, gazing upward and barking toward the dancers. Its presence dominates the foreground. In the background and center, three Sufi dervish dancers levitate high above the ground, their wide robes billowing outward as they spin. Although levitating, their feet still move rhythmically as if stepping on an invisible floor. Their figures are not sharp but blurred with ghostly motion blur, appearing as ethereal silhouettes dissolving into the air. The style is a dramatic palette knife impasto oil painting on crumpled, tea-stained paper. A single warm light source backlights the dancers, casting intense contrast across the scene. On the murky wet floor below, a distorted and broken reflection of the levitating blurred dancers is visible, while the anomalous dog remains solid, without shadow. The atmosphere is spiritual, dreamlike, and unsettling.",
