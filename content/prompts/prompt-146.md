Colossal surreal totem rising from cracked earth, a fusion of wood, bone, neon crystals, and mechanical parts, carved with shifting tribal faces that morph into cosmic entities, wings of Garuda made of smoke and fire, surrounded by absurd floating objects like giant noodles, masks, and broken statues, glowing.

Prompt enhance:

Envision an epic towering totem erupting from a fissured wasteland, sculpted from interwoven wood, bone, humming neon crystals, and exposed mechanical gears. Layer the surface with animated tribal visages that continuously morph into vast cosmic beings. Frame Garuda-inspired wings composed of smoke, embers, and liquid fire unfurling into the night sky. Orbit the structure with absurd levitating relics—oversized noodles looping through the air, ceremonial masks, fractured statues, and stray relic machinery—each emitting a radiant glow that bathes the scene in otherworldly luminescence.
