A majestic ancient serpent god inspired by Quetzalcoatl, hyper-detailed and ornate. The creature is a colossal feathered serpent with iridescent turquoise and jade scales, golden ornaments, glowing red eyes, and intricate Aztec engravings across its body. Each feather radiates gradient hues of purple, teal, and emerald, shimmering with divine light. Its head is adorned with sacred golden gears, cosmic runes, and ancient symbols of power. The composition is framed with celestial geometry and Mayan-inspired patterns, giving a mythic, regal, and otherworldly aura. Ultra-realistic textures, 8K resolution, cinematic lighting, mystical atmosphere, dark cosmic background with glowing dust, epic aesthetic masterpiece.
