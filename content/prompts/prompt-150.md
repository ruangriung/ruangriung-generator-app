A hyperdetailed maximalist masterpiece of a Tribal Warrior Woman, adorned with futuristic tribal armor fused with intricate Celtic knotwork patterns glowing in turquoise, red, and gold. Her pale porcelain skin is painted with tribal warpaint and geometric glowing tattoos, while her sharp yellow-green eyes radiate mystic power. She wears a massive tribal headpiece with feathers and turquoise ornaments, combined with Celtic knotwork designs wrapping around her body, armor, and weaponry. Her futuristic battle dress is woven with glowing knotwork sigils, layered in fractal-like complexity.

Surrounding her is a surreal aura of intertwining Celtic knot patterns forming an infinite maze, chaotic yet symmetrical, weaving into tribal totems, spirals, and glowing runes. The background is a storm of glowing geometric knotwork interlaced with tribal mysticism â€” surreal, otherworldly, maximalist, highly detailed, ultra 8K resolution, masterpiece, badass, powerful, complex, no equal.
