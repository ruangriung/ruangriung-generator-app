A highly intricate and hyper-detailed digital painting of a face split into two contrasting halves. One half is a vibrant, chaotic explosion of fiery orange and red energy, forming elaborate, flowing, and decorative patterns with a luminous, glowing eye. The other half is a calm, ethereal display of cool blue and purple cosmic energy, with delicate, luminous lines, subtle green accents, and scattered stars. The overall image is rich in detail with cinematic lighting and a complex interplay of light and shadow, giving a mystical and profound impression. The style emphasizes intricate patterns and a fantastical, detailed aesthetic, in the style of fantasy art.
