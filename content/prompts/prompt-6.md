A hyper-detailed and intricate digital painting of a face, split into two contrasting halves. One half blazes with a chaotic explosion of fiery orange and red energy, forming elaborate, flowing patterns and a luminous, glowing eye. The other half is a serene, ethereal display of cool blue and purple cosmic energy, with delicate, luminous lines, subtle green accents, and a scattering of stars. The image is rich in detail, with dramatic cinematic lighting creating a complex interplay of light and shadow, evoking a mystical and profound atmosphere. The style is a blend of high-fantasy art and digital surrealism, emphasizing intricate patterns and a fantastical aesthetic.
