A futuristic female cyborg warrior wearing a black hooded cloak, with long dark hair and glowing blue cyber visor glasses displaying digital interfaces. Her body is a seamless fusion of organic and mechanical parts, detailed with metal plates, wires, neon lights, and orange glowing circuits across her torso and arms.

The design features intricate mechanical components, exposed connectors, and a high-tech armor aesthetic blending sci-fi and cyberpunk styles. The atmosphere is moody with dark, cinematic lighting and a focused portrait composition that emphasizes her intense gaze.

Rendered in ultra-realistic 8K quality, the concept art channels inspirations from Paul Chadeisson and Beeple, highlighting realistic textures, photo-realism, depth of field, and an AI android aesthetic. Capture a futuristic dystopian tone with hyper-detailed craftsmanship and immersive visual storytelling.
