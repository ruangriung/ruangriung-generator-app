A surreal, chaotic, and epic digital art scene depicting a female figure with her body unnaturally twisted and folded inside a giant cracked eggshell — the upper half shattered open like broken glass. The egg rests precariously on the sharp tip of a standing elephant’s ivory tusk. The elephant is alive, with a stern, deeply serious expression, eyes filled with silent wisdom and tension. Its trunk coils tightly around the eggshell, as if guarding or restraining it.

The elephant’s ears have transformed into massive bat wings, stretched wide, translucent and veined with glowing crimson lines, radiating eerie energy.
Its body is wrapped with rusty chains and barbed wires, tangled chaotically around its legs and torso — symbols of captivity and struggle.
Beneath them, the ground is covered with black rose petals mixed with dust and street debris, forming a haunting and poetic texture.

In the background, towering ancient pillars rise into a dark, fog-laden sky — cracked, fragmented, some levitating mysteriously in the air.
The atmosphere is filled with floating glass shards, swirling smoke, and flashes of metaphysical light in purple, red, and gold.
The entire scene exudes surrealism, dark fantasy, and post-apocalyptic dreamscape energy — chaotic yet majestic, filled with deep symbolism and dramatic visual tension.

Lighting: cinematic, dramatic shadows, dense fog, HDR ultra-realistic illumination.
Details: extreme texture realism, chaotic composition, high contrast, photorealistic depth, dreamlike yet haunting atmosphere.
Style: Salvador Dali-inspired surrealism, chaotic epic composition, dark symbolism, masterpiece digital art.
