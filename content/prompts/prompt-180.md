Trypophobia effect, manipulation art, glossy solar lighting, a surreal artistic depiction of a woman with a chessboard hat, her body seemingly intertwined with several floating chessboards. She wears black and white striped stockings, countless eyes, and repeating holes while the suspended boards create a sense of weightlessness and illusion. The background forms a fractal chess pattern, intensifying the dreamlike quality of the scene.
