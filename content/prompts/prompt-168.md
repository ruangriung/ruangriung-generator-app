psychedelic macabre Dracula, impeccably dressed in a black cape, sits in his old sculpture of gold, purple, and white with big pillar cave skulls. Ladies in white dresses tease, whisper, and kiss. The cave is lavish and slightly decadent. Red wine drops on the ground, a lady crawling, possibly a bat demon Dracula, stands silhouetted against a clouded moonlit sky. His face is obscured by the bat demon, his cape and regal bearing cruel and mysterious. A sense of foreboding permeates the dramatic scene.
