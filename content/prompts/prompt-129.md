HYPER-DETAILED DARK FANTASY DEMONIC THRONE — A skeletal deity with a flaming crown of emerald fire, sitting cross-legged on a glowing lotus of ice-blue light. His face is a death mask with hollow eyes burning like black holes, mouth wide open dripping shadows. He wears a majestic robe adorned with peacock feathers glowing with eerie neon patterns, stained with blood. Around him, rivers of blood flow filled with cracked skulls and broken ritual relics. 

Two colossal demon guardians with dragon-lion heads, fangs dripping, armored in ornate battle gear, stand at his side, holding massive glowing blood-forged swords. Their eyes blaze with infernal fury, their scales shimmer with iridescent green and crimson fire. Behind them, a cosmic abyss swirls — galaxies bleeding red, shattered stars, occult symbols floating in the void. 

Above, ritual bells and chimes sway in mid-air, dripping blood instead of sound. Surrounding the scene: giant dark flowers bloom, their petals made of flesh and bone, sprouting crimson veins. The atmosphere is apocalyptic, oppressive, drenched in horror and divine wrath, painted in a surreal, ultra-detailed, brutal, nightmarish style.
