Ultra detailed surreal artwork in the style of Escherian glasswork, impossible glass geometry spiraling infinitely, reflective translucent surfaces, kaleidoscopic refractions of light, crystalline corridors bending in paradoxical directions, seamless fusion of glass fractals and infinite architecture. At the center stands The Crow gothic woman with white hair, mysterious presence, pale skin, sharp gothic makeup, dark leather outfit with crow-like details, holding her signature mask, surrounded by crows reflected endlessly in glass shards. The scene is illuminated with spectral glow, refracted rainbow hues breaking through the glass, surreal symmetry, mind-bending reflections, cinematic atmosphere, 8K ultra resolution, hyper realistic yet surreal, breathtaking and epic.
