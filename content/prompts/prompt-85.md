Hyper-realistic cinematic photo of a man (use reference photo) surfing dynamically among giant crashing waves. Instead of a normal surfboard, he rides a single oversized flip-flop shaped surfboard, designed like soft rubber with realistic texture, white and green colors, branded with the word “Swallow.” The scene is vibrant, full of water spray and energy, captured in dramatic lighting with sharp details. Ultra HD 8K quality, cinematic atmosphere.
