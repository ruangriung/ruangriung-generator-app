A surreal and hyper-realistic digital painting of a human face in profile, breaking apart like cracked, weathered stone. The cracks reveal a glowing, intense blue eye that shines with unnatural clarity, surrounded by fractal-like patterns. Within the fragmented interior of the face lies a distorted desert landscape â€” mesas and buttes warped in impossible shapes, bending and twisting into the sky. A floating, ancient stone staircase spirals endlessly upward through the void, partially broken and disappearing into shadow. Instead of an oasis, there is a mysterious glowing structure resembling a pool of liquid light, emitting an eerie green-blue hue. Gnarled, leafless trees bend in unnatural directions. Strange symbols hover faintly in the air. The stormy sky above churns with swirling dark clouds, pierced by abstract lightning patterns and soft, ominous light sources that seem to follow no natural rule. The palette uses deep browns, desaturated earth tones, with cold blues and glowing teals. The scene feels otherworldly, heavy with symbolic unease and dreamlike dread. Vertical composition, complex fantasy surreal art, highly detailed, 8K resolution.
