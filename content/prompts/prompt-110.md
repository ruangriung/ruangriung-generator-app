Summon an ultra-detailed 9:16 cinematic horror tableau of Ayu Dian transformed into a monstrous clay-like entity emerging from a dark swampy forest. Her entire body is sculpted from mud and soil, distorted and asymmetrical, with grotesque limbs constantly reshaping and dripping as if the earth itself is alive. Weave emerald and gold glowing veins through the clay mass, illuminating long straight silver hair matted with muck and partially submerged in sludge.

Embed multiple tortured human faces within the clay surface, their expressions frozen mid-scream, half-buried and twisting as if trapped souls are trying to claw free. Let her form merge seamlessly with the swamp pit, tree roots, and moss-covered earth—warped trunks and tangled roots should dissolve into her body, making it impossible to tell where the creature ends and the environment begins.

Flood the scene with thick emerald mist and warped shadowed trees, keeping the lighting cinematic yet oppressive: deep darkness pierced by the eerie green luminescence and sharp golden highlights licking across wet textures. Focus on hyper-realistic mud and clay surfaces, dripping strands, and constantly shifting anatomy. Emphasize a predatory awakening mood, chaotic and nightmarish, while avoiding anything cartoonish or 3D-rendered—this should feel like a living horror fantasy captured in photoreal detail.
