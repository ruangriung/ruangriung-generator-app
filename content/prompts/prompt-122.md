Hyper-artistic multi-exposure surreal portrait of a nomad in mid-step, wearing a worn-out maroon beanie (kupluk merah maroon kumal), complex colorful streetwear layered like a moving tapestry, patterns of abstract graffiti, tribal motifs, sacred geometry, woven fabrics glowing with hidden symbols, the outfit feels alive, fluttering with spectral colors. His walking silhouette fractures into countless overlapping exposures, each fragment a metaphor of wandering: deserts dissolving into oceans, ancient ruins blooming into neon skylines, mountains splitting into holographic grids, timepieces melting into stardust, faces of strangers fading into smoke, maps tearing themselves apart then reassembling, flocks of birds transforming into arrows of light, a river flowing upward into the night sky, constellations tangled in telephone wires. The exposures layered like brushstrokes of chaos and memory, textures painterly yet glitching, color palette both earthy and transcendent: maroon, ochre, cobalt blue, emerald green, ultraviolet, silver dust. Light and shadow colliding in a cinematic chiaroscuro, atmosphere dreamlike yet disorienting, highly detailed, 8k. Overlay ethereal Indonesian typography woven into the fabric and sky, faint but poetic: "Perjalanan nomad bukan sekadar langkah, tetapi puisi yang ditulis angin, fragmen dunia yang saling bertabrakan, menjadi peta jiwa yang tak pernah selesai."
