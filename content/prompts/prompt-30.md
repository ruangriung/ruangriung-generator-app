Epic experimental artwork with dissolving effect, combining Surrealism, Doodle Art, Pop Style, bold Indonesian typography (ngopi pagi), and propaganda poster aesthetics.

Main character: A punk-inspired young man with wild black-red mohawk hair, covered in tattoos and piercings, wearing an oversized yellow mesh jacket with “indra ai” logo, punk accessories, ripped black jeans, and worn-out Converse shoes. He sits casually, leaning back and hold coffee smoking a cigarette, exuding rebellion and freedom.

The scene bursts with melting shapes, chaotic doodle lines, dripping paint textures, and collaged surreal elements dissolving into the background, merging street art vibes with vintage propaganda poster graphics.

Typography "HARI INI KURASA KOPI NIKMAT SEKALI "in bold Indonesian letters melts into the composition like graffiti slogans.

Highly detailed, epic composition, chaotic yet harmonious, cinematic lighting, 8K resolution, experimental style, visually overwhelming masterpiece that leaves viewers in awe.
