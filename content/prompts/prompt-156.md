**Penulis:** Ayu Dian

**Prompt:**
Cinematic hyper-detailed maximalist low-angle view from ground level, showing Ayu Dian—a woman with silver hair—as a colossal titan stepping down onto a massive mountain. Her giant foot dominates the foreground as it crushes and splinters the rocky peak, debris scattering into the air. From this extreme bottom-up perspective, her full body towers impossibly high, wings spreading into the sky: multiple emerald-feathered wings, mechanical wings glowing with fractal circuitry, and crystalline wings refracting stormlight. Around her, chaotic floating islands drift through spiral storm clouds illuminated by violent emerald-gold lightning. The cracked earth below glows with molten emerald light as if infused with her divine power. Her expression remains serene yet terrifyingly divine, giving contrast between beauty and destruction. The sense of scale is overwhelming, emphasizing the titan’s godlike power as mountains shatter beneath her step.

**Style:** hyperdetail maximalism, surreal epic fantasy

**Lighting:** storm lightning flashes with emerald-gold glow, dramatic under-lighting from molten cracks, shadows towering upward

**Mood:** apocalyptic, divine, overpowering, awe-striking

**Realism:** ultra-detailed textures of giant skin, crushed mountain rock, wings, molten earth, storm clouds

**Rasio:** 9:16
