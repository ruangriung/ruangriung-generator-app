Minimalist pencil sketch artwork, portrait of the model (use reference image). Simple and clean lines, not overly detailed, but clearly showing the model’s facial character and expression. The pose should be dynamic—slightly turned head, tilted shoulders, or subtle movement for a lively yet elegant portrait. Background in warm beige-brown (cream brown) with artistic random splashes of watercolor in soft multicolors. Add gentle watercolor accents only on selected areas of the portrait to highlight important details, not covering the whole image. Use calm, natural tones for watercolor combined with strong black pencil strokes. Final artwork should look elegant, expressive, minimalistic, and modern. Aspect ratio 9:16.
