Masterpiece Oceanic dystopia, 9:16 ratio, mixed-media collage style. At the surface of a toxic sea floats an oversized handmade paper boat, Indonesian-style children’s paper boat, scaled large enough for two adults to stand inside naturally. On the bow of the paper boat stands a wet-haired man with leftover shampoo foam still on his head, wearing a white sleeveless singlet and bright pink leggings. He stands closely behind a woman dressed in elegant late-1910s fashion like Rose from the Titanic film — corseted waist, long flowing dress, delicate hat and gloves. The woman stretches her arms wide open to the sides, fully extended like Rose in the iconic Titanic “I’m flying” pose. The man embraces her gently from behind like Jack, both facing the red-tinged horizon as if serenely embracing doom. A large DSLR camera with a massive telephoto lens lies casually abandoned on the deck of the oversized paper boat. The sky above is slightly red, filled with swirling radioactive poisonous clouds. Below the surface of the water lies a devastated underwater world with no void: broken plastic chairs typical of cheap Indonesian brands, a traditional charcoal iron, seaweed made from shredded batik fabric, shattered coral reefs, a sickly pale fish with a chicken’s head almost dying, a floating piece of fried tempeh shaped like a fish, a pair of blue Swallow flip-flops locked together with a padlock, a single horribly rotten, foul-smelling shoe, an antique rotary telephone half-buried in sand, and a glass bottle containing a message inside. Rich texture, surreal yet melancholic, highly detailed, mixed collage, painterly + photo elements combined.
