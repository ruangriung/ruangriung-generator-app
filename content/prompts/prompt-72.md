A complex, surreal, and symmetrical hybrid psychedelic artwork inspired by a gothic nightmare. The composition features sharp neon acid drips combined with soft pastel colors, creating a visually intense and dreamlike atmosphere. At the center stands a highly detailed and symmetrical Balinese Leak statue radiating dark mystical energy. The floor is a black-and-white checkerboard fading into swirling pastel mist. Surrounding the scene are symmetrical flocks of eerie bats and crows flying across a stormy, dark sky. The background is filled with intricate, fractal-like psychedelic patterns and textures, mirrored perfectly on both sides. Vivid high-contrast colors dominate the piece â€” electric purples, glowing greens, hot pinks, deep blues, and blacks. Mysterious lighting effects illuminate the scene with an ethereal glow. The entire image feels chaotic yet harmonious, intensely detailed and rich with dark fantasy symbolism. Vertical 9:16 aspect ratio.
