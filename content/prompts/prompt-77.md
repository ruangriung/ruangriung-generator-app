A hyper-detailed, ultra-psychedelic digital collage from a chaotic, fragmented perspective. The scene is an overwhelming storm of visual disorder — a maximalist nightmare of Indonesia’s suffering under corruption. Images, textures, and fragments clash like torn posters and broken glass, layered without symmetry, all held together by jagged lines, wires, and red marker strokes that slash across the collage like wounds. The entire composition is fractured into glossy, asymmetrical frames and shards of broken glass, giving the impression of a shattered mosaic window of reality.

At the center rises a godlike monstrous entity of corruption, its face a constantly shifting mask of suit-wearing rats, grinning shadows, and interlocking money-pattern geometries: glowing rupiah banknotes, fragmented bribes, impossible golden palaces melting.

One eye is a bottomless pit of stolen wealth glowing in ultraviolet fire; the other, a swirling prison of broken promises and shattered ballots.

From its crown and jaw erupt countless tendrils — glowing pipelines, contracts, and chains of debt — in radioactive pink, poisoned green, toxic orange, and dark ultramarine. They spiral through the people, wrapping them into silence, like barbed wires slicing across the cracked glass frames.

The fractured-glass collage background shows chaotic layers within jagged frames:

Warped black-and-white newspaper headlines bending into screams, sliced by thick red lines, contained inside broken glass panes.
Sacred mosques and parliament domes collapsing into recursive mandalas of bureaucracy, their reflections splintered across glass shards.
Mobius bridges of unfinished infrastructure, rusting toll gates, and ghost buildings, trapped within irregular glossy panels.
Melting alien altars that resemble courtrooms, judges’ hammers dripping ink, encircled by glowing cracks.
Javanese glyphs and glowing batik circuitry twisted into corporate logos, fractured across uneven mosaic shards.
Fractal vines of corruption reports and illusions of fake justice, stretching across shattered glossy surfaces.

Added dramatic scenes inside the chaotic mosaic:

A mass demonstration surging through the broken frames, banners waving amid smoke and fire.
A figure in the crowd raising the Indonesian red-and-white flag high, glowing defiantly within the chaos.
Swarms of grotesque rats gnawing at the Garuda symbol, tearing its wings and claws as the emblem shatters into glass fragments.
A lone young man in an ojek online jacket standing at the forefront, holding back a massive armored riot vehicle (baja rantis) with his bare hands, veins glowing with unreal strength, framed like a heroic panel in the mosaic.
