  "prompt": "Impasto chiaroscuro painting of Ayu Dian in a dual vertical frame. Both sides show her back-to-back, each facing 1/3 profile sideways, emphasizing their duality. On the right frame: Ayu Dian as a normal human, holding notebooks and writing tools gently against her chest. She wears elegant emerald green and gold clothing, her expression calm, her silver hair softly lit, with thick expressive impasto brush strokes. On the left frame: Ayu Dian as a ruthless witch, with her left hand gripping a soil-stained skull and her right hand clutching a twisted emerald-gold staff. Her nails are long, her skin pale and weathered, her witch attire in emerald and gold tattered, entwined with parasitic plants that cling to her body like sinister companions. The two profiles are posed back-to-back, divided by a vertical wall of creeping vines that serve as the boundary. Around the whole scene, tangled vines and roots grow as a natural frame. The chiaroscuro lighting is dramatic, casting half their faces into shadow, enhancing the contrast between innocence and menace. Impasto paint textures dominate, thick, chaotic, and richly layered in emerald, gold, earthy browns, and dark shadows.",
