A surreal, dark, post-apocalyptic scene of a man sitting on a wooden chair in a ruined, abandoned concrete building with broken walls, exposed rebar, and scattered debris. The man wears ripped, dirty clothes and brown leather boots, his hands resting calmly in front of him. Instead of a head, he has a giant Earth globe dripping with red paint or blood, symbolizing a bleeding planet. Red liquid runs down his shirt and onto the floor, forming a dramatic pool. Beside him on the ground is a bright red round sign with a black painted smiley face, the eyes and mouth dripping like smeared ink or blood. The atmosphere is moody, cinematic, and dystopian, with dramatic lighting, dust particles in the air, and shadows enhancing the emotional intensity. Ultra-realistic, hyper-detailed, 8K digital art, concept art style.
