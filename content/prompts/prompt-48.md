Surreal liquid watercolor dreamscape of an ethereal geisha with flawless porcelain-gloss skin, holding an ornate Chinese oil-paper umbrella painted with blooming peonies and drifting ink strokes, the umbrellaâ€™s canopy melting into swirling rivers of vibrant cerulean, crimson, magenta, and gold. Her flowing silk kimono unravels into streams of liquid color that cascade into an infinite Escher-like recursive staircase, each step dripping in wet-on-wet watercolor textures. Above, a vast surreal night sky swirls with chaotic nebula-like clouds in deep indigo and violet, pierced by a radiant oversized full moon glowing with iridescent hues, its surface fracturing into floating shards of light. Surreal koi fish with shimmering translucent fins swim weightlessly through the air, weaving between moonlight beams and rivers of paint, their scales glowing like stained glass. Abstract lanterns morph into koi, petals, and molten glass orbs, scattering neon-pastel light into the mist. The entire composition bends under an extreme fish-eye lens, curving reality into a mesmerizing spherical panorama, every detail painted with dynamic watercolor brush strokes, luminous gradients, and high-gloss all-porcelain finishing.
